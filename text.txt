Kafka: distributed publish-subscribe messaging system(speed, scalabilty and durability)

Producer: the application that sends the message(an array of data)

Consumer: the application that receives the message sent by the producer.

Kafka Broker: Kafka Server; producer and consumer use it as an agent to send and receive messages.

Cluster: A group of computers @ executing one instance on a kafka broker.

Topic: The name for the data stream. Producer sends/ Consumer receives messages from a particular data stream.

Partition: Breaking down data in each topic and distributing them across different brokers across the clusters.

Offset: A sequence number assigned to each message arriving into the kafka server.

Consumer groups: A group of consumers acting as a single unit. 
##Partitioning and consumer groups are used for scaling an application.

Kafka and zookeeper: store logs. Kafka uses zookeeper to manage clusters.
